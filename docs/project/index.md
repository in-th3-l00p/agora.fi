# project description

AGORAFI is a decentralized platform where communities create autonomous virtual spaces and build their own economies. It merges NFT-based digital real estate, DeFi yield mechanics, community governance, and AI-driven content into self-sustaining ecosystems.

## the core idea

Communities deserve more than chat servers and social feeds. AGORAFI gives every community a **Space** — an isometric virtual city where members can own property, earn income, govern collectively, and grow a shared economy.

Each Space is a grid of purchasable **tiles**. A tile represents a digital property — a startup's headquarters, a VC's office, a community hub. But unlike traditional NFTs, AGORAFI tiles are **Living Tiles**: they own assets, generate yield, collect rent, earn royalties, and participate in governance — all autonomously, around the clock.

## key innovation: Living Tiles

Traditional NFTs are static — you buy them, hold them, maybe sell them. AGORAFI tiles are fundamentally different:

- **They own things.** Each tile has its own wallet that holds tokens, vault positions, and other assets.
- **They earn income.** Tiles generate staking yield, collect rental payments, and receive royalties from secondary sales.
- **They act autonomously.** Auto-claim rewards, auto-compound earnings, receive payments — no manual intervention required.
- **They transfer atomically.** When you sell a tile, the buyer gets everything: the NFT, the wallet, all assets inside, all income streams. One transaction.

A tile isn't just a picture on a blockchain. It's an autonomous economic agent that works for you.

## how Spaces work

A **Space** is a themed community environment built around a specific interest, industry, or geography. Each Space has:

- **A tile grid** — an isometric city map where users buy and customize tiles
- **A governance token** — for voting on proposals and shaping the Space
- **A DAO treasury** — funded by tile sales, controlled by token holders
- **Sub-spaces** — specialized areas like a News Factory, Marketplace, Innovation Gallery, or Governance Chamber
- **An AI news feed** — automatically generated content about activity within the Space

Spaces are self-governing. Token holders propose and vote on how treasury funds are spent, which partnerships to pursue, and how the Space evolves.

## who is it for

- **Startup ecosystems** — founders showcase companies, investors discover deals, communities organize events
- **Industry verticals** — DeFi protocols, gaming guilds, creator collectives build shared hubs
- **Geographic communities** — regional tech scenes organize, collaborate, and gain visibility
- **DAOs and collectives** — any group that wants to own shared digital infrastructure and govern it together

## what makes it different

| Traditional NFT platforms | AGORAFI |
|--------------------------|---------|
| NFTs are static collectibles | Tiles are autonomous economic entities |
| Value comes only from resale | Value comes from yield, rent, royalties, and governance |
| Communities live on Discord | Communities have their own governed virtual space |
| Revenue goes to platform | Revenue goes to tile owners and the community DAO |
| No built-in governance | Full on-chain DAO governance per Space |
